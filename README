libscds (lib simple C data structures)
by Maxim Atanasoff
Free for everyone to use, modify and distribute.

A collection of a few data structures contained within headers, that provide type safe, generic, reusable containers for your C programs.
Each container only needs a single header file -- include only what you need, requiers no linking/compiling.
The library is currently bare-bones, but I do plan to extend it in the future. Please have a look at `examples.c` to understand how it's used.
